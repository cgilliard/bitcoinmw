## SHA-3 Implementation License

### Andrey Jivsov's Public Domain Dedication

The following notice applies to the SHA-3 implementation by Andrey Jivsov:

Works when compiled for either 32-bit or 64-bit targets, optimized for 64 bit.

Canonical implementation of Init/Update/Finalize for SHA-3 byte input.

SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA-512 are implemented. SHA-224 can easily be added.

Based on code from http://keccak.noekeon.org/ .

I place the code that I wrote into public domain, free to use.

I would appreciate if you give credits to this work if you used it to write or test your code.
